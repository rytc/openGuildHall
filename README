# openGuildHall

### Note: this is an ancient project I wrote in 2011. *I do not recommend using this in production.* 

openGuildHall was a CMS written for online gaming clans/guilds wirtten in PHP with MySQL database backend that I wrote back in 2011. The project started as a web site I was developing for a gaming community I was apart of in those days. During development, I decided to turn the project from something specific for this group, into an generic open source project that could be used by any community. While I never officially launched the project, I did do a soft-launch for the guild I was apart of. The group started to dimish around the same time the site was launched simply due to the member's real-life responsibilities so the site never saw full use.
